## 1v1-Pygame-Shooter
My first venture into pygame, coded in a couple hours.
Mainly a project for practicing object orientated programming.
Came across multiple obstacles but in the end was great fun to create.

Might come back and add power-ups that effect player's speed and bullet caps, speed, etc...

## Run The Game
Simply ensure you have pygame installed, if not, `pip install pygame`.

Then just run the main.py; `python3 main.py`

This was **developed on linux**, so migration to windows may provide some errors.

## Controls

**Player 1**
* W -> UP
* A -> LEFT
* S -> DOWN
* D -> RIGHT
* SPACE -> SHOOT

**Player 2**
* UP ARROW -> UP
* LEFT ARROW -> LEFT
* DOWN ARROW -> DOWN
* RIGHT ARROW -> RIGHT
* RIGHT CTRL -> SHOOT

## Mechanics
Each player begins with 5 lives. \
Your aim is to reduce the other player's lives to 0 to win.

You can get lives through powerups, and other abilities such as speed, which stack.

And that's it!
