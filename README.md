# 1v1-Pygame-Shooter
My first venture into pygame, coded in a couple hours.
Mainly a project for practicing object orientated programming.
Came across multiple obstacles but in the end was great fun to create.

Might come back and add power-ups that effect player's speed and bullet caps, speed, etc...
